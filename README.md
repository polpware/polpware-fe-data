# Pirncipleware-fe-data

## Introduction 

This project consists of a set of high-level components about observable data, memory relational database, ngrx store, and more. 
These components are available in their typescript source files. Although there might be some concerns about usability, 
having their source files available helps users to pick up the components that are only needed. 

Note that since 2.0, we started to use Angular 6.0.
